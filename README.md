# Decision Tree Implementation from Scratch and with scikit-learn

This repository contains two implementations of the Decision Tree algorithm:
1. **Custom Decision Tree** built from scratch.
2. **scikit-learn Decision Tree** implementation for comparison.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using:
- A **custom implementation** from scratch, providing insight into how the algorithm works at a low level.
- The **scikit-learn** library, one of the most popular machine learning libraries, for ease of use and comparison.

Both implementations are tested on the **Iris dataset** to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `collections`
